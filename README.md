## 📄 Abstract

## 🎯 Introduction

In educational institutions, managing appointments manually is time-consuming and error-prone. This project solves that problem by offering a full-fledged, responsive, and accessible solution where appointments can be created, tracked, approved, and reviewed in real-time.

The system is divided into three key roles:

- **Admin**: Controls teacher access, views overall activity.
- **Teacher**: Views and manages student requests.
- **Student**: Books appointments and tracks updates.
